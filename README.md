# Enhetskonverterare v 1.1

The name "Enhetskonverterare" is in Swedish and translates to Unit-converter. in v1.0 this program was written entirely in Swedish but i've changed the whole laungage to English. 

---What is this program?---
This is a basic unit-converter that convert mostly imperial units to metric units. The program is built around one main menu with five sub-menus that each corresponds with different categories in units.
Navigate all the menus using the coresponding number of the menu choices. When you enter a sub-menu you will be presented with all the available unit-converters for that sub-menu category. When you have made a choice you will be asked to enter a value (float accepted). Then the program will return both the entered value + the converted value followed by a repeating of the sub-menu choices.

---What's new in version 1.1?---
-Sub-menus with each unit category
-More unit-functions

This is a program that i made as a hobby-project to sharpen my skills in programming.
